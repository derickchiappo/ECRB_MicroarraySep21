Analysis of publicly available microarray data from GEO involving differential expression analysis and correlation.

For my Ph.D. in clinical research medicine investigating the therapuetic effectiveness of targeting the interaction between S100A12 and RAGE in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV).

AAV is a rare autoimmune disease with an incidence of 13 to 20 cases per million in Europe that untreated has 90% death rate within two years (Prendecki and Pusey, 2018). The three main compounds used to treat AAV are cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, and rituximab (Geetha et al., 2018). Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug of phosphoramide mustard and has a toxic metabolite, acrolein, which inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis (Wall and Harper, 2012). The use of cyclophosphamide is associated with multiple complications including leukopenia, hemorrhagic cystitis, and long-term risk of urinary and haematological cancers (Wall and Harper, 2012). The use of long-term cyclophosphamide and prednisolone is also associated with cardiovascular complications, with 14% of AAV patients having an event within 5 years after diagnosis(Wall and Harper, 2012). As a result, there is an urgent need to develop steroid and/or cyclophosphamide-sparing treatment regimens. My Ph.D. 

One part of my Ph.D. is to investigate if the expression of S100A12 and genes affected by the ligation of S100A12's receptor, RAGE, are upregulated in AAV. Therefore, this project describes the analysis of a microarray dataset generated from the cDNA of renal biopsy samples of patients with AAV. 

There are two projects in this repository:

1. Differential Gene Expression Analysis
2. Relationship between differentially expressed genes and infiltrating immune cells
