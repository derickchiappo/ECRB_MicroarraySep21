In this analysis, I used parts of the SPEC package desigend by Dr. Christopher Bolen. This repository provides the zip file containing the all the R scripts they developed. 
Further information about the SPEC package can be found at http://clip.med.yale.edu/SPEC/ or the original publication (PMID: 21702940, doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-12-258).
